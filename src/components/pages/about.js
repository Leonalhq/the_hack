            Questioning the flow, bits and pieces of data that collectively become the intricacies and vulnerabilities within computing
            is the ultimate springboard to smarter solutions. My transition from a love of literature and writing into writing lines of code seems almost intrinsic
            to some as a convergence of curiosity. As an author, I’ve encouraged curiousness in the face of uncertainty — believing it is fundamental
            to the writing process. Integral to the development of original solutions and design, curiosity is core to the Product co. — serving as a space
            where creativity and curiosity thrive. — Hozier, P. William `
